"""
This library includes the following functions for image manipulation.

mask_cell(): To read a masked image file into a NumPy array.

read_image(): To read an image file into Python as a greyscale Image.

find_object(): To detect objects in an image within a given cell_mask.

find_overlap(): To find objects that occur in two channels and threshold for
percent of overlap.

count_objects(): To count objects in an image given a lower and an upper size limit.
